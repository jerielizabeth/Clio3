1 My faith looks up to Thee,

Thou Lamb of Calvary, Savior divine!

Now hear me while I pray,

Take all my guilt away,

O let me from this day

Be wholly Thine!


2 May Thy rich grace impart

Strength to my fainting heart,

My zeal inspire;

As Thou hast died for me,

O may my love to Thee

Pure, warm, and changeless be,

A living fire!


3 While life's dark maze I tread,

And griefs around me spread,

Be Thou my guide;

Bid darkness turn to day,

Wipe sorrow's tears away,

Nor let me ever stray

From Thee aside.


4 When ends life's transient dream,

When death's cold, sullen stream

Shall o'er me roll;

Blest Savior, then, in love,

Fear and distrust remove;

O bear me safe above,

A ransomed soul!


Amen.
