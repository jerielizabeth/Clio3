1 Lead, kindly light, amid the encircling gloom,

lead thou me on.

The night is dark, and I am far from home;

lead thou me on.

Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see

the distant scene, one step enough for me.


2 I was not ever thus, nor prayed that thou

shouldst lead me on.

I loved to choose and see my path, but now

lead thou me on.

I loved the garish day, and, spite of fears,

pride ruled my will: remember not past years.


3 So long thy power hath blest me, sure it still

will lead me on,

o'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till

the night is gone;

and with the morn those angel faces smile,

which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.
