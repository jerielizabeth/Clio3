1 Alleluia! Alleluia! 

  Hearts to heaven and voices raise;

  Sing to God a hymn of gladness,

  Sing to God a hymn of praise.

  He who on the cross as Savior

  For the world's salvation bled,

  Jesus Christ, the King of Glory,

  Now is risen from the dead.


 Now the iron bars are broken,

  Christ from death to life is born;

  Glorious life, and life immortal,

  On this resurrection morn.

  Christ has triumphed, and we conquer

  By His mighty enterprise;

  We with Him to life eternal

  By His resurrection rise.
