1 Nearer, my God, to Thee,

Nearer to Thee!

E'en though it be a cross

That raiseth me,

Still all my song shall be,

Nearer, my God, to Thee;

Nearer, my God to Thee,

Nearer to Thee!


2 Though like the wanderer,

The sun gone down,

Darkness be over me,

My rest a stone;

Yet in my dreams I'd be

Nearer, my God, to Thee;

Nearer, my God to Thee,

Nearer to Thee!


3 There let my way appear,

Steps unto heav'n;

All that Thou sendest me,

In mercy giv'n:

Angels to beckon me

Nearer, my God, to Thee;

Nearer, my God to Thee,

Nearer to Thee!


4 Then, with my waking thoughts

Bright with Thy praise,

Out of my stony griefs

Bethel I'll raise;

So by my woes to be

Nearer, my God, to Thee;

Nearer, my God to Thee,

Nearer to Thee!


5 Or if, on joyful wing

Cleaving the sky,

Sun, moon, and stars forgot,

Upward I fly,

Still all my song shall be,

Nearer, my God, to Thee;

Nearer, my God to Thee,

Nearer to Thee!
