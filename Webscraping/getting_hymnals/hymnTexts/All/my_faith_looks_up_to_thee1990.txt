1 My faith looks up to thee, 

thou Lamb of Calvary, 

Savior divine! 

Now hear me while I pray, 

take all my guilt away;

O let me from this day 

be wholly thine! 


2 May thy rich grace impart 

strength to my fainting heart, 

my zeal inspire; 

as thou hast died for me, 

O may my love to thee 

pure, warm, and changeless be, 

a living fire! 


3 While life's dark maze I tread,

and griefs around me spread, 

be thou my guide; 

bid darkness turn to day, 

wipe sorrow's tears away, 

nor let me ever stray 

from thee aside. 


4 When ends life's transient dream, 

when death's cold, sullen stream, 

shall o'er me roll; 

blest Savior, then, in love 

fear and distrust remove; 

O bear me safe above, 

a ransomed soul!
