Holy Bible, book divine,

Precious treasure, thou art mine;

Mine to tell me whence I came;

Mine to teach me what I am;

Mine to chide me when I rove;

Mine to show a Saviour's love;

Mine thou art to guide and guard;

Mine to punish or reward;

Mine to comfort in distress,

Suffering in this wilderness;

Mine to show by living faith,

Man can triumph over death;

Mine to tell of joys to come,

And the rebel sinner's doom;

O thou holy book divine,

Precious treasure, thou art mine.
