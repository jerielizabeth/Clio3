1 Lord of all being, throned afar,

Thy glory flames from sun and star;

Centre and soul of every sphere,

Yet to each loving heart now near!


2 Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray

Sheds on our path the glow of day;

Star of our hope, Thy softened light

Cheers the long watches of the night.


3 Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn;

Our noontide is Thy gracious dawn;

Our rainbow arch, Thy mercy's sign;

All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine.


4 Lord of all life, below, above,

Whose light is truth, whose warmth is love,

Before Thy ever-blazing throne

We ask no lustre of our own.


5 Grant us Thy truth to make us free,

And kindling hearts that burn for Thee;

Till all Thy living altars claim

One holy light, one heavenly flame.


Amen.
