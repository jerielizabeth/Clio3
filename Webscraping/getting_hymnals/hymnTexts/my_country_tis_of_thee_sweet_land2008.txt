1 My country, 'tis of thee, 

Sweet land of liberty, 

Of thee I sing: 

Land where my fathers died, 

Land of the pilgrims' pride, 

From ev'ry mountainside 

Let freedom ring! 


2 My native country, thee, 

Land of the noble free, 

Thy name I love: 

I love thy rocks and rills, 

Thy woods and templed hills; 

My heart with rapture thrills, 

Like that above. 


3 Let music swell the breeze, 

And ring from all the trees 

Sweet freedom's song: 

Let mortal tongues awake; 

Let all that breathe partake; 

Let rocks their silence break, 

The sound prolong. 


4  Our fathers' God, to Thee, 

Author of liberty, 

To Thee we sing: 

Long may our land be bright 

With freedom's holy light; 

Protect us by Thy might,

Great God, our King!
