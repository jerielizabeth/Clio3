1 Nearer, my God, to Thee,

Nearer to Thee,

E'en though it be a cross

That raiseth me;

Still all my song shall be,

Nearer, my God, to Thee,

Nearer to Thee.


2 Though like A wanderer,

Weary and lone,

Darkness comes over me,

My rest a stone;

Yet in my dreams I'd be

Nearer, my God, to Thee,

Nearer to Thee.


3 There let my way appear

Steps unto heaven;

All that Thou sendest me

In mercy given:

Angels to beckon me

Nearer, my God, to Thee,

Nearer to Thee.


4 Then, with my waking thoughts

Bright with Thy praise,

Out of my stony griefs

Altars I'll raise;

So by my woes to be

Nearer, my God, to Thee,

Nearer to Thee.


5 Or if on joyful wing,

Cleaving the sky,

Sun, moon, and stars forgot,

Upwards I fly,

Still all my song shall be,

Nearer, my God, to Thee,

Nearer to Thee.


Amen.
