1  O what precious balm and healing,

Jesus, in Thy wounds I find!

Ev'ry hour that I am feeling

Pains of body and of mind;

Should some evil thought rush in,

And provoke my soul to sin,

Thoughts of Thy deep wounds from sinning

Keep me in its first beginning.


2 Should some lust or sharp temptation

Prove too strong for flesh and blood,

Lo! I think upon Thy Passion,

And the breach is soon made good:

Or should Satan press me hard,

Thinking I am off my guard,

Christ, I say, for me was wounded,

And the tempter flees confounded.


3 If the world my heart entices

On the broad and easy road,

And doth by its gay devices

Silence ev'ry thought of God,

When the heavy load I see

Which, dear Lord, was laid on Thee,

I can still each wild emotion,

Calm and blest in my devotion.


4 Lord, whate'er may pain or grieve me,

Thy dear wounds can make me whole;

When my heart sinks, they revive me,

Life pours in upon my soul:

May Thy comfort render sweet

Ev'ry bitter cup I meet;

Thou who by Thy death and Passion

Hast procured my soul's salvation.


5 Lord, on Thee alone I stay me,

Safely hid beneath Thy wing;

Death can neither hurt nor slay me,

Thy death took away his sting:

That I may in Thee have part,

Comfort, strengthen, heal my heart;

Light, and life, and love bestowing,

All from Thy free mercy flowing.


6 Well of life, if Thou art near me,

Springing deep within my heart,

When the last dread hour shall try me,

I can feel no inward smart:

If I hide myself in Thee,

Not a foe can injure me;

He shall overcome who hideth

In Thy wounds, and there abideth.
