1 Holy Bible, book divine,

Precious treasure, thou art mine;

Mine to tell me whence I came;

Mine to teach me what I am;


2 Mine to chide me when I rove;

Mine to show a Savior's love;

Mine thou art to guide and guard;

Mine to punish or reward;


3 Mine to comfort in distress,

Suff'ring in this wilderness;

Mine to show, by living faith,

We can triumph over death;


4 Mine to tell of joys to come,

And the rebel sinner's doom;

O thou holy Book divine,

Precious treasure, thou art mine.


Amen.
