1 Holy Father, hear my cry;

Holy Saviour, bend Thine ear;

Holy Spirit, come Thou nigh:

Father, Saviour, Spirit, hear.


2 Father, save me from my sin;

Saviour, I Thy mercy crave;

Gracious Spirit, make me clean:

Father, Son, and Spirit, save.


3 Father, let me taste Thy love;

Saviour, fill my soul with peace;

Spirit, come my heart to move:

Father, Son, and Spirit, bless.


4 Father, Son, and Spirit -- Thou

One Jehovah, shed abroad,

All Thy grace within me now;

Be my Father and my God.


Amen.
