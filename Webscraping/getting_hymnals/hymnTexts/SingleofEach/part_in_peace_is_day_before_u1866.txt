Part in peace! is day before us?

Praise His name for life and light;

Are the shadows lengthening o&#8217;er us?

Bless His care who guards the night.

Part in peace! with deep thanksgiving,

Rendering, as we homeward tread,

Gracious service to the living,

Tranquil memory to the dead.

Part in peace! such are the praises

God, our Maker, loveth best;

Such the worship that upraises

Human hearts to heavenly rest.
