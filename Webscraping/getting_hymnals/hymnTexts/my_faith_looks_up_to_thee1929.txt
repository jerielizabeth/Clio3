1929
1. My faith looks up to Thee,

Thou Lamb of Calvary,

Savior divine;

Now hear me when I pray,

Take all my sin away,

O let me from this day

Be wholly Thine!


2. May Thy rich grace impart

Strength to my fainting heart,

My zeal inspire;

As Thou hast died for me,

O may my love to Thee,

Pure, warm, and changeless be,--

A living fire!


3. While life's dark maze I tread,

And griefs around me spread,

Be Thou my Guide;

Bid darkness turn to day,

Wipe sorrow's tears away,

Nor let me ever stray

From Thee aside.
