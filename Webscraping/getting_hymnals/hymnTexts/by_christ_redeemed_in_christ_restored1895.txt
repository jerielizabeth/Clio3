1 By Christ redeemed, in Christ restored,

We keep the memory adored,

And show the death of our dear Lord

Until He come.


2 His Body broken in our stead

Is here in this memorial bread,

And so our feeble love is fed

Until He come.


3 The streams of his dread agony,

His life-blood shed for us, we see:

The wine shall tell the mystery

Until He come.


4 And thus that dark betrayal night

With the last advent we unite

By one blest chain of loving rite

Until He come:


5 Until the trump of God be heard,

Until the ancient graves be stirred,

And, with the great commanding word,

The Lord shall come.


6 O bless'd hope! with this elate

Let not our hearts be desolate,

But, strong in faith, in patience wait

Until He come.


Amen.
