1 Through the love of God our Saviour,

all will be well.

Free and changeless is his favour,

all, all is well.

Precious is the blood that healed us,

perfect is the grace that sealed us,

strong the hand stretched forth to shield us,

all must be well.


2 Though we pass through tribulation,

all will be well.

Ours is such a full salvation,

all, all is well.

Happy, still in God confiding,

fruitful, if in Christ abiding,

holy, through the Spirit's guiding,

all must be well.


3 We expect a bright tomorrow,

all will be well.

Faith can sing through days of sorrow,

'All, all is well.'

On our Father's love relying,

Jesus every need supplying,

in our living, in our dying,

all must be well.
