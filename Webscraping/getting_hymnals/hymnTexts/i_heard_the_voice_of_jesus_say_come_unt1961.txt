I heard the voice of Jesus say,

"Come unto me and rest;

Lay down, thou weary one, lay down

Thy head upon my breast."

I came to Jesus as I was,

Weary and worn and sad,

I found in him a resting place,

And he has made me glad.

I heard the voice of Jesus say,

"Behold, I freely give

The living water; thirsty one,

Stoop down and drink, and live."

I came to Jesus, and I drank

Of that life-giving stream;

My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,

And now I live in him.

I heard the voice of Jesus say,

"I am this dark world's Light;

Look unto me, thy morn shall rise,

And all thy day be bright."

I looked to Jesus, and I found

In him my Star, my Sun;

And in that light of life I'll walk,

Till trav'ling days are done.
