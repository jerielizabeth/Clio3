1 Arm these Thy soldiers, mighty Lord,

With Shield of faith and Spirit's Sword.

Forth to the battle may they go

And boldly fight against the foe.


2 With Banner of the Cross unfurled,

They overcome the evil world

And so at last receive from Thee

The palm and crown of victory.


3 Come, ever-blessed Spirit, come

And make Thy servants' hearts Thy home.

May each a living temple be

Hallowed forever, Lord, to Thee.


4 Enrich that temple's holy shrine

With sev'nfold gifts of grace divine;

With wisdom, lips and knowledge bless,

With counsel, strength, fear, godliness.


5 O Trinity in Unity,

One only God and Persons Three,

In whom, through whom, by whom, we live,

To Thee we praise and glory give.


6 O grant us so to use Thy grace

That we may see Thy glorious face

And ever with the heav'nly host

Praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost!
