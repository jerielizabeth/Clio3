1 My God, accept my heart this day

And make it always Thine

That I from Thee no more may stray,

No more from Thee decline.


2 Before the cross of Him who died,

Behold, I prostrate fall;

Let ev'ry sin be crucified,

And Christ be all in all.


3 Anoint me with Thy Spirit's grace

And seal me for Thine own

That I may see Thy glorious face

And worship near Thy throne.


4 May the dear blood once shed for me

My blest atonement prove

That I from first to last may be

The purchase of Thy love!


5 Let ev'ry thought and work and word

To Thee be ever giv'n;

Then life shall be Thy service, Lord,

And death the gate of heav'n.
