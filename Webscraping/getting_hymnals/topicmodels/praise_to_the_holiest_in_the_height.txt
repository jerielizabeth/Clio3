1 Praise to the Holiest in the height

And in the depth be praise;

In all His words most wonderful,

Most sure in all His ways.


2 O loving wisdom of our God!

When all was sin and shame,

A second Adam to the fight

And to the rescue came.


3 O wisest love! that flesh and blood,

Which did in Adam fail,

Should strive afresh against the foe,

Should strive and should prevail:


4 And that a higher gift than grace

Should flesh and blood refine;

God's presence and His very Self,

And essence all-divine.


5 O generous love! that He, Who smote

In Man for man the foe,;

The double agony in Man

For man should undergo;


6 And in the garden secretly,

And on the cross on high,

Should teach His brethren, and inspire

To suffer and to die.


7 Praise to the Holiest in the height,

And in the depth be praise;

In all His words most wonderful,

Most sure in all His ways.


Amen.
