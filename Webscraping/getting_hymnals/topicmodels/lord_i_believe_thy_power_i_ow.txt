Lord! I believe; Thy power I own

Thy word I would obey;

I wander comfortless and lone,

When from Thy truth I stray.

Lord! I believe; but gloomy fears

Sometimes bedim my sight;

I look to Thee with prayers and tears,

And cry for strength and light.

Lord! I believe; but oft, I know,

My faith is cold and weak;

Make strong my weakness, and bestow

The confidence I seek!

Yes, I believe; and only Thou

Canst give my soul relief;

Lord! to Thy truth my spirit bow,

Help Thou my unbelief!


Help Thou mine unbelief.


Amen.
