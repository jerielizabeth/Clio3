1 Pray, brethren, pray!

The sands are falling;

Pray, brethren, pray!

God's voice is calling.

Yon turret strikes the dying chime;

We kneel upon the verge of time: 


Refrain:

Eternity is drawing nigh!

Eternity is drawing nigh! 


2 Praise, brethren, praise!

The skies are rending;

Praise, brethren, praise!

The fight is ending.

Behold, the glory draweth near,

The King Himself will soon appear: [Refrain]


3 Watch, brethren, watch!

The years are dying;

Watch, brethren, watch!

Old time is flying.

Watch as men watch the parting breath,

Watch as men watch for life or death: [Refrain]


4 Look, brethren, look!

The day is breaking;

Hark, brethren, hark!

The dead are waking.

With girded loins all ready stand,

Behold, the Bridegroom is at hand: [Refrain]
