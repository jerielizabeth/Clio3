1 Come, Holy Ghost, in love


Shed on us from above


Thine own bright ray:


Divinely good Thou art;


Thy sacred gifts impart


To gladden each sad heart:


O come today!



2 Come, tenderest Friend and best,


Our most delightful Guest,


With soothing power:


Rest, which the weary know;


Shade, 'mid the noontide glow;


Peace, when deep griefs o'erflow, --


Cheer us this hour.



3 Come, Light serene, and still,


Our inmost bosoms fill;


Dwell in each breast:


We know no dawn but Thine;


Send forth Thy beams divine


On our dark souls to shine,


And make us blest.



4 Exalt our low desires;


Extinguish passion's fires;


Heal every wound:


Our stubborn spirits bend,


Our icy coldness end,


Our devious steps attend,


While heavenward bound.



5 Come, all the faithful bless:


Let all who Christ confess


His praise employ;


Give virtue's rich reward;


Victorious death accord,


And, with our glorious Lord,


Eternal joy.



Amen.
