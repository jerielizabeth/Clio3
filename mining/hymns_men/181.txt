1 If God Himself be for me,


I may a host defy;


For when I pray, before me


My foes confounded fly.


If Christ, the Head, befriend me


If God be my support


The mischief they intend me


Shall quickly come to naught.



2 This I believe, yea, rather,


In this I make my boast,


That God is my dear Father,


The Friend who loves me most;


And that, whate'er betide me,


My Savior is at hand


Through stormy seas to guide me


And bring me safe to land.



3 I build on this foundation:


That Jesus and His blood


Alone are my salvation,


The true, eternal good.


Without Him all that pleases


Is valueless on earth;


The gifts I owe to Jesus


Alone my love are worth.



4 My Jesus is my Splendor,


My soul's bright beaming Sun;


Were He not my Defender


Before God's awful throne,


I never should find favor


And mercy in His sight,


But be destroyed forever


As darkness by the light.



5 He canceled my offenses,


And saved my soul from death;


'Tis He who ever cleanses


Me from my sins through faith.


In Him I can be cheerful,


Bold, and undaunted aye.


In Him I am not fearful


Of God's great Judgment Day.



6 Naught, naught, can e'er condemn me,


Nor set my hope aside;


Now hell no more can claim me,


Its fury I deride.


No sentence e'er reproves me,


No ill destroys my peace,


For Christ, my Savior, loves me


And shields me with His grace.



7 His Holy Spirit dwelleth


Within my willing heart,


Tames it when it rebelleth


And soothes the keenest smart.


He crowns His work with blessing,


And helpeth me to cry,


'My Father!' without ceasing,


To Him who dwells on high.



8 And when my soul is lying


Weak, trembling, and opprest,


He pleads with groans and sighing


That cannot be expressed;


But God's quick eye discerns them,


Although they give no sound,


And into language turns them


E'en in the heart's deep ground.



9 To mine His Spirit speaketh


Sweet word of holy cheer,


How God, to him that seeketh


For rest, is always near,


And how He hath erected


A city fair and new,


Where what our faith expected


We evermore shall view.



10 In yonder home doth flourish


My heritage, my lot;


Though here I die and perish,


My heav'n shall fail me not.


Though care my life oft saddens


And causeth tears to flow,


The light of Jesus gladdens


And sweetens ev'ry woe.



11 Who clings with resolution


To Him whom Satan hates


Must look for persecution


Which never here abates;


Reproaches, griefs and losses


Rain fast upon his head,


A thousand plagues and crosses


Become his daily bread.



12 All this I am prepared for,


Yet am I not afraid;


By Thee shall all be cared for,


To whom my vows were paid.


Though life and limb it cost me,


And all the earthly store


Which once so much engrossed me,


I love Thee all the more.



13 Not fire, nor sword, not thunder,


Shall sever me from Thee;


Though earth be rent asunder,


Thou'rt mine eternally.


Not hunger, thirst, nor danger,


Not pain, or pinching want,


Nor mighty princes' anger


My fearless soul shall daunt.



14 No angel, and no gladness,


No throne, no pomp, nor show,


No love, no hate, no sadness,


No pain, no depth of woe,


No scheme of man's contrivance,


Though it be great or small,


Shall draw me from Thy guidance


Nor one of these, nor all!



15 My merry heart is springing,


And knows not how to pine;


'Tis full of joy and singing,


And radiancy divine, 


The Sun whose smiles so cheers me


Is Jesus Christ alone;


To have Him always near me


Is heav'n itself begun.
